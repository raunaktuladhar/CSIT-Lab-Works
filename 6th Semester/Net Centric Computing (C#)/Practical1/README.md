## Questions

1. Write a program to demonstrate class, constructor, properties and method
2. Write a program to demonstrate method overloading?
3. Create a class Calculate which contains data member num1 and num2 both in integer and
methods setCalc() to set the data, calcSum() that calculate the sum of num1 and num2
and display the result, calcMulti() that calculate the multiplication of num1 and num2 and
returns the result, calcDifference that calculate the difference between num1 and num2
and display the result. Now, create some instance of Calculate and invoke all the
methods.
4. Create a class Number having instance variable x and y both in integer, default
constructor that set the value of x and y to 0, parameterized constructor that sets the value
of x and y, method findOdd() that calculates the even no. occurring between x and y and
display the result, findEven() that calculates the odd no. occurring between x and y and
display the results. Now, create some instance of Number and invoke all the methods.
5. Create a class Shape that contains instance variable length, breadth and height. Create a
default constructor that sets the value of instance variable to zero, constructor with two
parameter that will sets the value of length and breadth only and constructor with three
parameter that will sets the value of length, breadth and height. After this create
calcAreaRectangle() that calculates the area of rectangle, calcVolumeBox() that
calculates volume of box and display the result. Now create first object of Shape wihich
will have name rectangle and calls constructor with two parameter and
calAreaRectangle() method, create second object of Shape that will have name Box
which will call constructor with three parameter and calcVolumeBox() method.
6. Create a class EmployeeDetails having data member empId, empName, empGender,
empAddress, and empPosition, constructor to set the details and display method to
display the details. Create a subclass SalaryInfo that will inherit EmployeeDetails having
own data member salary which will record salary per year, constructor to set the value of
salary and method calcTax() that deduct the tax on salary and display the final salary. Tax
rate is given as (if salary &lt;= 400000 tax is 1%, salary between 400001 to 800000 tax is
10% and salary &gt; 800000 tax 20%). Now create the object of Salary info and demonstrate
the scenario.
7. Write a program to demonstrate single level, multilevel inheritance?
8. Write a program to demonstrate use of base keyword
9. Write a program to demonstrate method overriding (dynamic polymorphism)?
